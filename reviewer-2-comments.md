# Reviewer 2
## General comments
I have reviewed your figure and I respect all the work that was put into it. 
Incorporating a piece of fruit within a logo is certainly a novel approach.
That said, I have some major concerns regarding the values that your peach conveys. 
Thus, I have provided comments to help your peach better symbolize eternal youth and be more accessible for color-blind users.

## Specific comments
- Please change the color of the peach to [252,141,89]. Please refer to https://colorbrewer2.org for appropriate color combinations in the future.
- Please change the color of the leaf to [145,207,96].
- Please change all outline widths to 1.
- Please decrease the ASB text width to 4.
- Please change the year to 'Virtual 2020'.
