# Breakout 3

Unfortunately, the figure got rejected from the Journal. But fear not! There are other journals to apply to.
You decide that some of the comments made by the previous reviewers did not make sense, and you want to change them back before resubmitting.

## Changes to make
- Change the peaches color to its original color. **_Refer to script 1_**
- Change the leafs color to its original color. **_Refer to script 2_**
- The text for 'Virtual 2020' is to large and overlapping the line. Reduce the text size to 16. **_Refer to script 5_**

** Hint: You can find the commit that the changes were made, checkout to that commit, then re-commit this for two of these changes.
