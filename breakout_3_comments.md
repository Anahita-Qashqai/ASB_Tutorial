### General comments
I thought this figure looked very good before? I'm not sure what silly reviewer wanted changes done to it, but it doesn't look good anymore!The colors are absurd! I have listed my comments on what to revert or change.

### Specific comments
- Revert the changes done to the peaches color to its original color. **_Refer to script 1_**
- Revert the changes done to the leafs color to its original color. **_Refer to script 2_**
- The text for 'Virtual 2020' is to large and overlapping the line. Reduce the text size to 16. **_Refer to script 5_**

* Hint: You can find the commit that the changes were made and revert that commit for two of these comments.

## Reviewer 2
### General comments
I have discovered that my color vision is very poor.
Please refer to reviewer ones comments to make the figure the best representation of ASB.
