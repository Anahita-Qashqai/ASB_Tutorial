# Breakout Room #1

## Background
You and your collaborators have made a recent discovery that will surely result in winning the prestigious
Nobel Peach Prize, awarded to the group of biomechanists with the best peach-related figure made entirely with 
code! Your team has been working for months and have just a few bugs to fix before submitting the figure to 
Nature for publication. Your team will be able to quickly fix these bugs in parallel thanks to version control.

The code used to generate your figure is comprised of an upper-level script `ASB_Tutorial/main_script.m`, which 
calls five numbered subscripts (e.g. `ASB_Tutorial/subscripts/script_1.m`). The data required to generate your 
figure is stored as CSV files at `ASB_Tutorial/data/`. 

If you need help remembering the git functions, refer to `ASB_Tutorial/git_cheatsheet.md`.

## Objective
Fix the bug in each subscript and generate the figure by running `main_script.m`.
