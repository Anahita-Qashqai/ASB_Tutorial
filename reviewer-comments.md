What a wonderful figure. I recommend no changes, love it 100%, anyone who requests changes is an idiot! I look forward to seeing you collect your Nobel Peach Prize.

## Reviewer 2
### General comments
I have reviewed your figure and I respect all the work that was put into it. 
Incorporating a piece of fruit within a logo is certainly a novel approach.
That said, I have some major concerns regarding the values that your peach conveys. 
Thus, I have provided comments to help your peach better symbolize eternal youth and be more accessible for color-blind users.
